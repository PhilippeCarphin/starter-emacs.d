#+TITLE: Good to go

A starting point for an emacs config with everything that is missing from stock
emacs.

Clone this repo as your =~/.emacs.d= and make sure that there is no =~/.emacs=
file.

Once that is done, you are *good to go* to

- Publish documents in all kinds of formats
- Take notes and organize them like a boss
- Get started with the org agenda
- Run code inside orgmode documents and make jupyter notebooks look like a silly toy.
- Use orgmode to do all kinds of literate programming

  - (examples coming soon)
